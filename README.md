 [!preview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bennami/Movie-browse/master/preview.png)

a website where you can browse through a huge library of movies, provided by [the Moviedb API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction)

### TO DO:

- styling:
  - make a nice carousel on homepage.[used slick-slider,might try another library since this one uses jquery and there is an    issue where the image wont load  at page load]
  - on hover card movie show title and a % rating
  - animations 
  - movie profile: add genre, add nice  icons, further styling and add  movie trailer
  
- browse through all movies on search(pagination) [works!, no next yet only dots]  
- make it responsive
- react routing to navigate through pages [works!]
- add page per movie and its routing [movie profile for home check! need to lift state to use that on search and other components]
- replace List component with search result instead of creating new one [ended up just reusing component on search route]
- make a login to save favourite movies and stuff
- REDUXXXX
- implement the spinner on fetch load cuz  weird

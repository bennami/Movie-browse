## Moviedb React app

 [Browse movies](https://bennami.github.io/Movie-browse/).

a website where you can browse through a huge library of movies, provided by [the Moviedb API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction)

### TO DO:

- styling:
  - make a nice carousel on homepage.
  - browse through all movies (pagination)
  - on hover card movie show title and a % rating
  - animations 
  
- make it responsive
- react routing to navigate through pages [works!]
- add page per movie and its routing
- replace List component with search result instead of creating new one[ended up just reusing component on search route]
- make a login to save favourite movies and stuff
